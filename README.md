In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine.

- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:


```bash

# using npm

npm start
```



## Step 2: Start your Application



Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:



### For Android


```bash

# using npm

npm run android

```



### For iOS



```bash

# using npm

npm run ios
```



If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.



This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.





## Congratulations! :tada:



You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
